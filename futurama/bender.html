Ummm…to eBay? I&#39;ve got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I&#39;m going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now &#39;I&#39;&#39; have to pay &#39;&#39;them&#39;!</p><ul><li>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</li><li>Oh, I don&#39;t have time for this.

It&#39;s a suppository.</li></ul><p>We don&#39;t have a brig. You&#39;re going to do his laundry? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p><p>When will that be? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p><p>No, I&#39;m Santa Claus! Oh, I don&#39;t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p><p>Hey, tell me something. You&#39;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&#39;re doing your laundry? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I wish! It&#39;s a nickel. I could if you hadn&#39;t turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p><p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! There&#39;s no part of that sentence I didn&#39;t like! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! And yet you haven&#39;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p><p>Bender, I didn&#39;t know you liked cooking. That&#39;s so cute. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ow, my spirit! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Our love isn&#39;t any different from yours, except it&#39;s hotter, because I&#39;m involved.</p><p>Oh, I don&#39;t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Good news, everyone! There&#39;s a report on TV with some very bad news!</p><p>There&#39;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Moving along… Soon enough. I love this planet! I&#39;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p><p>Why not indeed! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender, we&#39;re trying our best. Large bet on myself in round one. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p><p>Oh dear! She&#39;s stuck in an infinite loop, and he&#39;s an idiot! Well, that&#39;s love for you. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I saw you with those two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; at Elzars. Explain that.</p><p>That&#39;s a popular name today. Little &quot;e&quot;, big &quot;B&quot;? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? No, just a regular mistake. Also Zoidberg.</p></p>
