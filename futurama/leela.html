If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</h3><p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p><ul><li>Throw her in the brig.</li><li>File not found.</li><li>No, I&#39;m Santa Claus!</li></ul><p>But I&#39;ve never been to the moon! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by &quot;devil&quot;, I mean Robot Devil. And by &quot;metaphorically&quot;, I mean get your coat. And why did &#39;I&#39; have to take a cab?</p><p>Leela, Bender, we&#39;re going grave robbing. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p><p>I&#39;ll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. That&#39;s a popular name today. Little &quot;e&quot;, big &quot;B&quot;? Is today&#39;s hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? We&#39;ll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p><p>Fry, you can&#39;t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. It doesn&#39;t look so shiny to me. Oh dear! She&#39;s stuck in an infinite loop, and he&#39;s an idiot! Well, that&#39;s love for you.</p><p>Who am I making this out to? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I&#39;m Santa Claus! We&#39;ll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p><p>Who are you, my warranty?! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I&#39;m a thing. Fatal.</p><p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg &#39;fixes&#39; it… then perhaps gifts! Eeeee! Now say &quot;nuclear wessels&quot;! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p><p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I&#39;m Santa Claus! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Morbo will now introduce tonight&#39;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&#39;s good friend, Richard Nixon.</p><p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</p><p>Aww, it&#39;s true. I&#39;ve been hiding it for so long. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! And I&#39;d do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p><p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! It&#39;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p></p>
