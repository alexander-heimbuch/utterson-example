Clamps, burn down the crew.</p><p>How much did you make me? It&#39;s toe-tappingly tragic! <strong>Tell her you just want to talk.</strong> <em>It has nothing to do with mating.</em> Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p><h2 id="i-m-sorry-guys-i-never-meant-to-hurt-you-just-to-destroy-everything-you-ever-believed-in-">I&#39;m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</h2><p>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? No. We&#39;re on the top. I saw you with those two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; at Elzars. Explain that. I haven&#39;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p><ol><li>And I&#39;m his friend Jesus.</li><li>Can I use the gun?</li><li>That&#39;s right, baby.

I&#39;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</h3><p>You know, I was God once. Hey! I&#39;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? If rubbin&#39; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#39;t wanna be right. Why not indeed! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p><ul><li>I wish! It&#39;s a nickel.</li><li>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</li><li>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</li></ul><p>I found what I need. And it&#39;s not friends, it&#39;s things. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Now Fry, it&#39;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p><p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p><p>You are the last hope of the universe. What are their names? Daylight and everything. Fetal stemcells, aren&#39;t those controversial?</p><p>Why would I want to know that? They&#39;re like sex, except I&#39;m having them! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Michelle, I don&#39;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p><p>Fatal. Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. You guys aren&#39;t Santa! You&#39;re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Hello Morbo, how&#39;s the family? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p><p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Daylight and everything. Kids have names? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#39;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p><p>Ask her how her day was. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Tell them I hate them. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn&#39;t I break his legs?</p><p>Who are you, my warranty?! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#39;It is!&#39; My precious torso! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p><p>Ooh, name it after me! A true inspiration for the children. You don&#39;t know how to do any of those. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p><p>Look, last night was a mistake. No! Don&#39;t jump! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. And remember, don&#39;t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don&#39;t not do it!</p><p>I&#39;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Take me to your leader! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You&#39;d think it would be something you&#39;d have to freebase. I&#39;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p></p>
