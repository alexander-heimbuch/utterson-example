Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I'm not part of.

Keep your mind limber. Watching ice melt. __This is fun.__ *Tell him time is of the essence.* I'm doing mental jumping jacks.

## I'm really more an apartment person.

I'm doing mental jumping jacks. This man is a knight in shining armor. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm generally confused most of the time.

1. God created pudding, and then he rested.
2. You're a killer. I catch killers.
3. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.

### God created pudding, and then he rested.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm generally confused most of the time. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

* I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
* I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.
* I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. God created pudding, and then he rested. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Tell him time is of the essence. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I like seafood.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Keep your mind limber. God created pudding, and then he rested.

This man is a knight in shining armor. You're a killer. I catch killers. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

Like a sloth. I can do that. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. You look…perfect. Only you could make those words cute. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. This man is a knight in shining armor. I like seafood. I like seafood. He taught me a code. To survive.

I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. This man is a knight in shining armor. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!
