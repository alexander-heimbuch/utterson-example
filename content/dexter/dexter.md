Cops, another community I'm not part of.
========================================

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Tell him time is of the essence. Cops, another community I'm not part of. He taught me a code. To survive.

I am not a killer. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! __God created pudding, and then he rested.__ *Like a sloth.* I can do that.

## Makes me a … scientist.

I am not a killer. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight in shining armor. He taught me a code. To survive.

1. Tell him time is of the essence.
2. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.
3. I'm really more an apartment person.

### I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm generally confused most of the time.

* I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.
* I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
* Cops, another community I'm not part of.

I'm partial to air conditioning. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm really more an apartment person. Cops, another community I'm not part of.

You all right, Dexter? God created pudding, and then he rested. I am not a killer. I have a dark side, too. Tell him time is of the essence. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm really more an apartment person. I am not a killer. I'm generally confused most of the time. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

You look…perfect. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Tell him time is of the essence. I am not a killer. God created pudding, and then he rested.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I'm not part of.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

Only you could make those words cute. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.
