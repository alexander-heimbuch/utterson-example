I like seafood.
===============

Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

I am not a killer. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. You're a killer. __I catch killers.__ *Watching ice melt.* This is fun.

## I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Tell him time is of the essence. You're a killer. I catch killers. Makes me a … scientist. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

1. You all right, Dexter?
2. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
3. I have a dark side, too.

### I'm generally confused most of the time.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I like seafood. Keep your mind limber. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

* Like a sloth. I can do that.
* This man is a knight in shining armor.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm really more an apartment person. God created pudding, and then he rested. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

He taught me a code. To survive. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

Like a sloth. I can do that. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I am not a killer. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. You look…perfect. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

You're a killer. I catch killers. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?
