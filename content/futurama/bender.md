Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
======================================================================

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Really?! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

__nd remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!__ *And until then, I can never die?* You know, I was God once.

## Can I use the gun?

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… A true inspiration for the children. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

1. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
2. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.
3. I never loved you.

### Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Say what? Ummm…to eBay? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

* I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
* Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
* Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

We don't have a brig. You're going to do his laundry? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

When will that be? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

No, I'm Santa Claus! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I wish! It's a nickel. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ow, my spirit! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Moving along… Soon enough. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Why not indeed! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender, we're trying our best. Large bet on myself in round one. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? No, just a regular mistake. Also Zoidberg.
