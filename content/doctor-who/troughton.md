Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
=====================================

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You've swallowed a planet! You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

## Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

1. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
2. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
3. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

* You've swallowed a planet!
* You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
* I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
