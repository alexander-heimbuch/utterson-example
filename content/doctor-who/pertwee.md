They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
========================================

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? __The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.__ *hellip;hey.* …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

## No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You've swallowed a planet! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
